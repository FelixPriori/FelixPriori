# Bonjour / Hi ðŸ‘‹

## Summary

My name is Felix (He/Him), I am a life-long learner and arts-oriented individual who fell in love with programming as a way to create and make ideas real. I am passionate about coding, and I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and take part in exciting projects. As a junior front-end developer, I enjoy working in a
collaborative environment, and I'm hoping to be part of a team making a difference in the web development world.

## Interests and hobbies

When there is no pandemic, you can often find me on the dance floor at [Cat's Corner Swing Dance School](https://www.catscorner.ca/en/), either teaching a class, or social dancing. I truly enjoy spending time learning about the arts and the culture it emerged from, and I especially love immersing myself in reading up about music. Other practices include: mindfulness, running, and playing videogames.

## Web development

I am a [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) graduate (February 2020 cohort), who has since been working full time as a front-end React.js developer. I am currently trying to hone my React skills by taking Kent C. Dodds' [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) workshop, and teaching myself [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) through online tutorials and personnal projects.
