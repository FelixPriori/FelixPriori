## :pushpin: Summary

My name is Felix (He/Him). With over four years of experience in front-end development, I am a dynamic professional and an arts-oriented individual captivated by the transformative power of programming to bring ideas to life. I have contributed to over a dozen client projects across a wide range of industries, and I always have a passion project ongoing.

## :video_game: Interests and hobbies

You can often find me on the dance floor at [Cat's Corner Swing Dance School](https://www.catscorner.ca/en/), either teaching a class or social dancing. I truly enjoy spending time learning about the arts and the culture it emerged from, and I especially love immersing myself in reading about music. Other practices include mindfulness, running, and playing board and video games.

## :rocket: Web development 

I am a [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) graduate (February 2020 cohort), who has since been working full-time as a front-end React.js developer. I am constantly teaching myself new skills, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/), and much more through online tutorials and personal projects. You can find in this GitHub most of what I've been working on in my personal time.

## ðŸ’» Work History

### [Webisoft](https://webisoft.com/) (2020 - 2021) - React.js Developer
__Humble beginnings__.
After graduating from Lighthouse Labs in April 2020, I landed a job at Webisoft, a small web agency startup based in MontrÃ©al. I was tasked to maintain, and build all of their [React.js](https://react.dev/) applications, which involved working on a long-standing app, an app which was just about ready to launch, and a new app in its infancy. The small size of the company and the different scopes for each project meant I had to learn how to adapt to a new environment quickly and independently.  

### [Nventive](https://nventive.com/en/) (2021 - 2022) - Web Developer
__Teamwork__.
At Nventive, I was part of a larger company with amazing devs to learn from. I worked on various projects, learning new technologies along the way such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and very briefly [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp) / [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet). While there, I had many opportunities to pair program with experienced, senior developers who taught me valuable skills when it comes to teamwork in software development.

### [Nurun](https://www.nurun.com/) (2022 - 2024) - Front-end Developer
__Flexibility & Quality__. I was recruited at the beginning of 2022 to work for Nurun, a veteran web agency which has a ton of projects from a wide range of industries around the world. I worked for impressive clients such as [Hydro-QuÃ©bec](https://www.hydroquebec.com/about/), [Cadillac](https://www.cadillaccanada.ca/en), [Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.ca/), and [ADMTL](https://www.admtl.com/) just to name a few. I had to adapt to new technologies, projects, and teams quickly as I was needed to jump from one project to another, while still having to maintain the highest possible code quality. While still doing the majority of my work in React.js and TypeScript, I had to learn technologies on the fly such as: [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/), [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/), and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) just to name a few. Their emphasis on accessibility had me work closely with a [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) expert, making sure that applications met [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) accessibility standards.

### The future (2024 - ?)
__Next steps__. I'm currently open for work! I am interested in either working for a company that has an in-house product or staying in the field of web agencies. My work experience has taught me to adapt quickly to a new environment and new teams, to pick up technologies on the go while maintaining rigorous work quality, and to always be curious and open-minded.
